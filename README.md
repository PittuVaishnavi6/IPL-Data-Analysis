#  IPL Data Analysis Project using Python

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** using Python's data analysis libraries — `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn`.

We analyze and visualize key aspects of the IPL such as top teams, top batsmen, winning patterns, popular venues, and more using two datasets: `matches.csv` and `deliveries.csv`.

---

##  Project Objective

The objective of this project is to explore IPL datasets and uncover valuable insights using Python's data visualization techniques. This helps in understanding team strategies, player performance, venue impact, and trends over multiple seasons.

---

##  Datasets Used

1. **matches.csv** – Contains match-level information such as season, city, toss result, winner, etc.
2. **deliveries.csv** – Contains ball-by-ball delivery data like batsman, bowler, runs, extras, dismissals, etc.

##  Features & Analysis Done

-  Total Seasons Played
-  Total Matches Played
-  Top 5 Winning Teams
-  Top 10 “Player of the Match” award winners
-  Top 10 Venues with highest match counts
-  Top 10 Batsmen by Balls Faced
-  Top 10 Run Scorers in IPL
-  Graphical Visualizations for all above using Seaborn/Matplotlib

---

##  Sample Output Visualizations

>  Note: Visuals like bar plots are generated by `ipl_analysis.py` using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

Examples:
- Bar plot of top winning teams
- Top player of match awardees
- Top venues
- Top run scorers and ball faced
